# Overview

Hello! In this project I hope to by utilizing a data set, answer some questions regarding broader natural disasters. How many there are, and in which nations? Where we should allocate our resources, who needs help, and how it has effected countires in the last decade, their GDP, the death rate etc... I also hope to be able to learn more about data analysis through the medium of the python language, a great tool for analyzing data! It provides a wide range of libraries and tools in order to accomplish this important task and is widly regarded as a language of data analysis. Though perhaps not so much as the R programming language.

I am analyzing multiple data sets describing in general the same thing. The impact of natural disasters on mankind. Specifically, the death rate, GDP impact, event type, location, date, and more. They should be included in the file, though I highly recommend a visit to the site which is included below. They have many different options to choose from in regards to this fascinating topiC

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Data Analysis Results

## Questions: 

* What is the average impact of natural disasters on a global scale, and what mitigation strategies might be best.
* Which countries need immediate attention regarding disaster managment?

## Answers:

### Question 1:
* I would say that the effects are obvious. Discplacement. Economic Damage. Death. Recovery Time. All are factors in the analysis of natural disasters.
  I think in this analysis one of the reasosn that you see more deaths from flooding and more droughts occuring is because these occur more, though in the 
  data, deaths from earthquakes and volcanic activity is major, it jut isn't frequent, which is of note. So I would say in order to best prepare for 
  future such events, countries will need to take steps to ensure protection against flooding and drought. Both the watery extremes as they seem to happen
  the most and cause the most death. For more isolated events such as earthquakes and volcanos, certain steps will also need to be taken, but should be of
  lower priority.

### Question 2:
* As demonstrated by our analysis in the first question and 5th, Dominica had about 368 % of their total GDP represented in damages caused by natural disasters.
  That was only in the last decade alone. I would say that countries taht need our immediate attention are those whose damages from natural disasters
  exceed about 75 % GDP. The odds of them recovering on their own are not high when it goes above this points, as they can't producce enough to meet 
  the environmental demand, let alone their own citizens. Some other nations of note which might require relief are third world nations (excluded beacuse of the broadness in this data set)
  or developing countries such as India. Other nations such as Italy France, and Spain might also require aid from time to time based on current circumstances.

As a note there are more questions within the document, in order to help answer these two.

# Development Environment

The tools which I used to devlope this software were Python programming language, as well as its packages and libraries, VSCode, and Github.

The language which I used as mentioned above is Python, I also used the Pandas package, as well as the numpy package to some extent, though in the final project I didn't use it at all.

# Future Work

* More time for a Markdown file documenting my learning.
* The website where I got the files had a large amount of data sets to choose from, could have used more, and probably should in future data analysis projects.
* Use .filter() or data conversion next time.
